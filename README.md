A recent study identified sleep-like behavior in the upside-down jellyfish *Cassiopea spp.*, contributing to the growing body of knowledge that suggests sleep-like behaviors evolved prior to the centralized nervous system. *Cassiopea spp*. are found in shallow, tropical waters and are known to be relatively heat-tolerant. Yet, less is understood about how increases in sea temperature could affect this sleep-like state. In this study, samples of *C. xamachana* collected from Key Largo, Florida, were recorded for two days under 12-hour day/night cycles in both ambient (23 °C) and elevated (32 °C) temperature regimes. Here, we leverage sleap.ai to track and quantify pulsation behavior over time, under both ambient and elevated conditions.
